    This class defines interfaces that are commonly used with loss functions

    functions, please refer to http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#loss-functions

    Note:
        Do not use this class directly, use one of the sub classes.

    Args:
        name (str): name of the loss function used by logging messages.
        criterion (torch.nn._Loss): one of PyTorch's loss function.  Refer
            to http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#loss-functions for
            a list of them.

    Attributes:
        name (str): name of the loss function used by logging messages.
        criterion (torch.nn._Loss): one of PyTorch's loss function.  Refer

            sub-classes.
        acc_loss (int or torcn.nn.Tensor): variable that stores accumulated loss.
        norm_term (float): normalization term that can be used to calculate
            the loss of multiple batches.  Implementation depends on individual
            sub-classes.
